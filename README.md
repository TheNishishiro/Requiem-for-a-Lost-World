# Requiem for a Lost World

A simple Vampire Survivors like game in 3D with AI generated assets, focused on a story driven narrative through rouge like progression.

The project is in a very early stage of development, so there is not much to see yet. But if you are willing to try it out, you can download the latest build from the [releases](https://github.com/TheNishishiro/Requiem-for-a-Lost-World/releases)

## Motivation

For the longest time I wanted to make a game. I also had a story I wanted to tell.
Unfortunately I am not a writer, nor an artist, nor a game designer.

Thanks to the recent AI advancements I could finally get my hands on art assets that I could use to prototype my game and see whether the idea is worth pursuing. With hopes that once it is done, I could hire an artist to replace the AI generated assets with something more professional.

I currently work on it in my free time whenever I don't feel completely burned out after work, so it is a long way to go.
 
VS's gameplay also looked like a perfect fit for my very first game, as it is simple game that did not require many assets with a straight forward gameplay loop I could build upon and expand as I learn.

I took a big inspiration from the way Arcaea and Cytus 2 tell their stories, as I think it is a very interesting way to make players uncover the story by themselves without directly handing it to them.

I don't want to commit to any screenshots or early descriptions of a story so that's all for now.
