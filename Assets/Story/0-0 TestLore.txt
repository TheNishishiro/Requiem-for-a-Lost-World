In the boundless see of dying flame, under cover of an infinitely dark black sun. Young man, tightly clutches form of another in his arms.
Warmth once emanating from that gentle being slowly dissipates into the air leaving nothing but a hole where heart used to be.
His mind, racing and frozen in time all the same.
Screams of people so crystal clear few moments ago all died down, leaving only a quiet crackling of fire to keep him company.

God's gaze, unfazed until now, rests on this pitiful image.
Who is this man? Insignificant.
And yet - his face - does spark curiosity of the divine being.
These features. So similar to the ones she has found on her very own, millennia ago. Under the same desolate sky.

So she descended from the skies, gracefully landing, her feet barely touching the blood stained ground in front of the pair.
There it was again. The face of a man, with nothing left to lose. 
But not broken.
No, far from it. An unmatched hatred, piercing even through the divine.

Feeling all to familiar. 
She extended her hand only to be met with a swift swing of a blade.
Cute - she thought - an untrained swing, she could tell.
