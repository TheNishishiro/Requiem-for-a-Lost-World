Hey... You there, wait a moment! Hey!
<character>Chitose
Finally cought up to you... let me catch my breath...
<character>???
Do you need anything? We are a little busy.
<character>Chitose
Oh? I was about to ask you the same thing, it's been fairly dangerous around here recently! It's not a place for casual walks.
<character>???
<thought>Places his hand on a handle of a sword attached to his belt
<character>???
We will be fine. But since you are here, could we ask you for directions towards Capital?
<character>Chitose
Sure thing! May I ask your names?
<character>Nishi
My name is Nishi and that shy one is Amelia, we have some very important message to deliver.
<character>Chitose
Nice to meet you, my name is Chitose. Anyway, if it's that important, how about I escort you? Capital is not that far away, we should be able to see it in no time and it will be much safer as well!
<character>Nishi
<thought>Looks at Amelia and then back towards the lively girl in front of him
<character>Nishi
Alright, lead the way, the faster we get there the better
<character>Chitose
Sure! Let's get a move on, follow me!
