As the dim light of the enigmatic blade illuminated the path ahead, Nishi's expression shifted dramatically; no longer encumbered by pain, his broken rib ceased slowing him down. His movements steadied, allowing him to navigate the difficult terrain of the cave with finesse and agility.  
  
Before long, he found himself back at the entrance where he had fallen earlier. Nishi gave the slippery tunnel walls a cursory examination before launching himself upwards from one wall to another, his feet finding support in even the smallest crevices. He ascended swiftly, reaching the surface once more.  
  
In less than a heartbeat, the gentle breeze once again caressed his dark hair. Fortunately, aside from the sound of rustling tree leaves, he could also hear the ominous breathing of the dark monstrosity looming above the girl's limp form.  
  
It took mere moments for the creature to sense Nishi's presence — its head snapped back in response like it did earlier. This time, however, Nishi remained undaunted, determined to seek vengeance.  
  
The monster lunged at Nishi, its claws slicing through the air with a resounding crash. Yet this time, they seemed to miss their mark entirely. With a quick, almost instinctive dodge, Nishi evaded the blow while delivering an uppercut to the creature's torso. A black liquid — presumably blood — seeped out of the wound before rapidly healing as the tiny moving fur-like tentacles worked together to patch up the injury within mere seconds.  
  
But that was enough; Nishi knew he could hurt it, and if it could be hurt — then it could also be killed.  
  
The monster retaliated with a slash of its deadly claws, but Nishi swiftly parried it with his blade, snapping off a piece of the sharp talon. Another small victory for the young man. Without giving him any time to celebrate, a tentacle burst forth from the creature's body, striking the ground where Nishi had stood just moments prior. The force sent rock, grass, and debris flying high into the air, suspending Nishi midair as he narrowly dodged the attack.  
  
He found himself staring at the bloody remnants of the creature's broken talon, his determination unwavering. He could not afford to falter now without dying a gruesome death. With immense effort, Nishi forced himself to stand once more, gripping the hilt of his sword with renewed purpose.  
  
A couple of images flashed through his mind — a desolate landscape full of ruins of what appeared to be an ancient civilization, a woman whose face felt all too familiar — igniting a surge of electricity throughout his body so intense that even nearby blades of grass reacted.  
  
Seemingly sensing the gathering energy, the monster leaped forward, intending to crush Nishi beneath its formidable weight.  
  
From Nishi's perspective, time seemed to slow down, each of the creature's movements visible as muscles tensed in preparation for impact. He jumped upwards, avoiding the monstrous assault before spinning in midair to gather momentum into his blade. Channeling the electric current surging through him into a powerful strike, he cut through the creature's body in two clean slices, causing it to explode in a shower of black blood, staining both Nishi and the forest foliage around him.  
  
For a moment, Nishi stood there, frozen by the sheer intensity of what had just transpired before giving out a long sigh. Finally, he turned his gaze toward the girl lying motionless on the ground before him.
