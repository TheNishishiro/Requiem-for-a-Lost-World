Enveloped by abyssal darkness punctuated only by weak beams of light seeping through the hole above, Nishi finds himself disoriented but alive after his tumble down the cave. A haunting silence envelops the cavernous space, broken only by the gentle dripping of water droplets onto the cold stone floor.  
  
Slowly raising himself from the unforgiving ground, Nishi leans heavily against a wall for support. As his gaze ascends towards the faint light filtering through the opening above, a fleeting notion of escape passes through his mind; however, he dismisses the idea instantly, acknowledging his battered condition wouldn't allow for climbing back up.  
  
Scanning his body for potential harm, he discovers a single broken rib as the most severe injury — yet an unrelenting exhaustion permeates every fiber of his being. Undeterred, Nishi continues onward, his footsteps echoing eerily within the vast tunnel. Distorted by stalagmites and punctuated by the occasional splash into unseen puddles, each step weighs heavily upon him.  
  
The oppressive darkness seems to thicken further as he delves deeper inside, thoughts of reemerging into the sunlight ebbing away. Yet he knows that should this labyrinth become any more treacherous, turning back will be the wisest decision.  
  
As he navigates the seemingly endless tunnel, his hand absentmindedly scrapes against harder sections of the cave wall, adding yet another scratch to his bruised knuckles. Then, he notices something unusual - it is oddly smooth and effortless to traverse.  
  
Curiosity piqued, he ventures further into this strange terrain until his senses are greeted with an unexpected discovery. The walls now feel metallic, akin to the weapon his father once attempted to teach him how to wield. “Walls made of metal...?” His words hang in the air as he falters momentarily, then advances undaunted.  
  
Nishi soon finds himself standing before another wall - one adorned with an incongruous doorknob. His hand instinctively grasps it, turning it with ease; the door creaks open, revealing a small room bathed in faint light. An array of unfamiliar objects line the shelves, all illuminated by the dim glow emanating from a large sword resting on the floor.  
  
Feeling drawn to the blade's hilt, Nishi closes his fingers around it; images flood his mind, overwhelming his senses and causing him to collapse onto the cold stone floor. Sweat beads upon his brow as dizziness takes hold, but the sensation subsides almost instantly.  
  
Summoning his remaining strength, Nishi reaches for the sword again, gripping it tightly. Once more, no visions assault him. He lifts the sword, finding it unexpectedly lightweight. As he retrieves a second object off the ground, his breath exhales heavily.  
  
With newfound determination, Nishi exits the room swiftly, guided by the warm glow of the blade. His thoughts race ahead, anxious about whether it's too late to save the blonde-haired girl who had been tossed away like a mere plaything not long ago.
