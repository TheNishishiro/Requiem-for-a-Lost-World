Throughout aeons, humans forged numerous religions, all centered around a supreme divine entity — creator and orchestrator of the cosmos. Why do these celestial beings ever direct their gaze upon mere specks of cosmic dust? Are we exceptional in their eyes... Or merely wishful thinking, grasping at straws seeking divine attention in our quest for purpose?  
  
Can we even compare ourselves to stars? What if we could ascend beyond them, perhaps even rival the divine beings themselves... Would we then... Finally capture their attention...?  
  
— Perhaps...  
  
In the desolate expanse of flickering flames, under the infinite black sun's somber shroud. A young man clutches tightly onto another form within his embrace.  
  
The warmth once emanating from that gentle presence ebbs away into the air, leaving behind an abyss where their heart used to be. Simultaneously, his mind races through time, frozen by the weight of loss.  
  
Receding screams echo through the air, now muffled by the deafening silence; replaced by the quiet crackling of fire, the only solace amidst the cacophony of despair.  
  
Unmoved thus far, God’s gaze alights on this meek spectacle.  
  
Who is this mortal, insignificant in the grand scheme of things?  
Yet — his visage sparks curiosity in the celestial observer.  
  
These features. Uncannily reminiscent of those found millennia ago beneath the very same forsaken sky.  
  
A divine being descended from the heavens, her feet barely grazing the blood-soaked earth before the pair. There it was again: the visage of a man, with naught left to lose. Yet - far from broken. An unyielding hatred radiated even through the divine.  
  
Familiar sentiments stirred within her soul...  
  
She extended her hand, only to meet with swift strikes of a blade, each one clumsy yet fueled by rage and desperation.  
  
“I will never forgive you!” resounded throughout the dead landscape  
  
With that declaration, the goddess offered a genuine smile.
