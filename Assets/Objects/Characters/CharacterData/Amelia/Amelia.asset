    EidolonQuote: "I opened my eyes, expecting to find myself in some kind of eternal
      darkness. Instead, I saw an angel standing over me, his face etched with concern.
      And then I realized that wasn't an angel at all \u2013 it was Nishi, holding
      me in his arms as if I were precious. That's the clearest memory I have of
      my life, and probably the best thing that's happened to me yet."

    EidolonQuote: Sometimes, when everything seems meaningless, I feel like I'm trapped
      in a spiral of despair. No matter how hard I try to help others, they still
      seem to stumble into trouble. Even when I do everything right, something goes
      wrong. It drives me crazy, and I end up getting depressed about it. Nishi tries
      to calm me down, but he gets frustrated too. He wants me to be happy, and I
      appreciate that...

    EidolonQuote: In my darkest moments, I remember the sounds of my parents fighting.
      The same arguments, the same hurtful words. I thought that if I could just
      finish it all, maybe the pain would stop. But that's not how life works. Amidst
      the ruins and fires, I clung to my life, desperate for anything to cling to.
      And then I met Nishi, who brought me warmth and comfort. But good things never
      last, do they?

    EidolonQuote: I used to worry if what we did was okay. Turns out, it is! Nishi
      showers me with attention and affection, and I've even started improving at
      my healing abilities. Slowly, but surely. I'm grateful for every moment with
      him, and I can't wait to become more useful to him...

    EidolonQuote: Possibly, if I'd never been shielded from pain... it wouldn't sting
      as much. But now that I've known love and happiness, I won't hesitate to face
      whatever the future holds.
