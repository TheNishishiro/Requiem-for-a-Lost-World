    50% of incoming damage, depleting acumulated <color=red>Binding</color> by the
    amount of damage shielded.\r\nEvery 10 seconds, convert 10% of the current <color=red>Binding</color>
    into a damage buff for 5 seconds, increasing base damage by 50% of the converted
    <color=red>Binding</color> value.\r\n<color=red>Binding</color> accumulation

    PassiveUpgradeDescription: Increase damage absorbtion of Binding by another 10%
    EidolonQuote: 'As the eternal darkness of a black hole eclipses the sun, casting
      a crimson red glow over the heavens, I alone remain. The girl who once danced
      among the stars is no more; her light extinguished by the void.



      I
      dance now, amidst the ashes of an old world, as the final remnants of hope
      fade away. Who cries, and who rejoices? It matters little to me. I am here,
      and I shall endure.'

    SkillUpgradeDescription: During ultimate's duration increase base damage by another
      25% of current Bind value
    PassiveUpgradeDescription: Every level increase healing recieved by 0.5%
    EidolonQuote: 'Dreams give meaning to life, or so they say. But what of the dreams
      of a bird with broken wings, yearning to soar back into the skies? Those dreams
      become shackles that bind it down, slowly leading it to its ultimate demise.



      And
      so too have my dreams become a prison, confining me within these crumbling
      walls of despair. No longer can I rise above this desolate landscape, for my
      heart is shattered, like the glass shards that once held the promise of a brighter
      future.'

    PassiveUpgradeDescription: Increase the damage buff duration to 7 seconds
    EidolonQuote: 'That weak girl wouldn''t know true pleasure! Bind them down, rip
      them apart, show them their worst nightmares. Watch their life drain away as
      the final spark in their eyes dims out into nothingness... Just as mine once
      did.



      And yet, even in death, there lies a twisted allure, a macabre
      fascination that draws me to the brink of madness. For in the darkness, I find
      solace, a fleeting respite from the agony of existence.'

      healing income
    EidolonQuote: 'Each step I take reverberates with the sound of countless bodies
      laying dormant beneath the rubble of what "she" once called home. As the day
      of judgment beckons, what are you thinking, my dearest darling?



      Doesn''t
      it prove my point, that all promises made were but illusions? Dreaming is worthless;
      in the end, not even celestial bodies stand a chance against the abyss. How
      magnificent!'

      At the end of the buff recover Bind equal to 10% of max health
    EidolonQuote: 'In the end, all the promises that "she" made were for naught.
      Doesn''t that just prove my point? Dreaming is worthless. In the end, even
      the stars themselves cannot resist the void''s crushing weight.



      As
      the last remnants of light fade, I behold the futility of existence, and in
      its face, I laugh maniacally, embracing the void as my own.'
