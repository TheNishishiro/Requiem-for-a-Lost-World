      and I''m the prettiest around here - and don''t you forget it. Let me be your
      guide through this mess, because I''m the only one who can keep you entertained.



      What
      do you mean you weren''t looking for me? Don''t play coy with me, darling.
      I know exactly what I want, and I''ll stop at nothing to get it.



      Wait,
      hold on! I''m not done with you yet!'

    EidolonQuote: 'Ugh, being this beautiful is exhausting. Especially when everyone
      expects me to be some kind of goddess just because of my looks. In the military,
      it''s even worse - all the guys are always hitting on me, and I have to constantly
      remind them that I''m their superior officer.



      But honestly, most people
      here see me as just a figurehead, someone to be obeyed without question. It
      gets lonely, you know? I wish there were more people I could actually connect
      with, but... Ah, it would be unprofessional of me, wouldn''t it?'

    EidolonQuote: 'Oh, Chitose? That girl''s a wild card, always bursting with energy
      like a fireworks explosion. I''ve never seen anyone match her intensity, but
      too bad we don''t get to hang out more often... or less often, depending on
      how you look at it.



      Of course, my own energy has its limits, too.
      Haha, who am I kidding? I''m a high-strung commander, always ready to spring
      into action. But sometimes, I wonder if it''s all worth it...'

      per character level
    EidolonQuote: 'I put on a smile, and pretend everything''s fine. But deep down,
      I''m dying inside. Being a squad leader used to be fun, back in the day when
      we were still just a bunch of misfits running around. But now, every time we''re
      sent outside those walls, I wonder how many will come back... and what''s waiting
      for us beyond the gates.



      It feels like we''re just disposable pawns
      for General David''s games. Soldiers, yes - but also playthings, waiting to
      be sacrificed on the altar of war.'

    EidolonQuote: 'When we''re out in the field, we make campfires and sing silly
      songs. We try to distract ourselves from the horrors ahead by telling jokes
      and eating baked potatoes over the flames. Anything to take our minds off the
      fight that''s coming.



      <color=red>But even the flames can devour us
      all, Fae. Don''t forget that.</color>'
