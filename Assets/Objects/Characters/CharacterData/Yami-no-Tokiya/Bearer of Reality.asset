    EidolonQuote: "I lived a peaceful life, a young girl without care in the world.\nLoving
      parents, a few but good friends and a future shaped to be a bright one. \nOn
      <b>that</b> day I ran over to my neighbor, tasked with delivering a letter
      from my mother. A really warm, sunny summer day.\n\nWhen I came back, mom was
      frantically digging through her paperwork. As a scientist she had... A lot
      of papers all over her room.\nThe TV was playing in the background, news channel
      calling everyone to stay calm and seek shelter. \nNeedless to say, these kind
      of news never work and soon enough all hell broke loose.\nMy mom packed me
      into the car and drove to the lab where people ran, yelled or just simply stared
      at computer screens.\n\nShe handed me a black wrist band, told me everything
      is going to be alright.\nMaybe I was young but I could still see the fear behind
      her smile.\nSoon after - sirens went off and the blue sky turned a hue of crimson.
      Then it darkened... And darkened some more... Until the sky turned deep shade
      of purple.\nMet with the end of the world, at the age of seventeen.\nBuildings
      crumbled, the lucky ones turned to ashes shortly after.\nMy mother wasn't so
      lucky, of course she couldn't have been... Her body mutated, skin rot in a
      blink of an eye and soon only a pile of unrecognizable, yet conscious flesh
      quivered in pain in my very arms."

    EidolonQuote: 'As I opened my eyes, I saw the desolate planet, towering buildings,
      energy lines, lush green on the horizon... <b>all gone</b>.

      No humans
      screamed for their lives anymore. No light penetrated the thick smoke.

      I
      got up from my knees, putting my "mother" down on the ground.

      My hand
      ventured towards my chest... But I couldn''t feel anything.


      To come
      to terms with what have happened took me longer that I would like to admit.

      These
      small lumps of flesh watched on to me with their big deformed eyes.

      One
      got crushed by a huge piece of debris - damaged but alive.

      Another one
      burned by the fire - also survived.

      Some bleed, incapable of bleeding
      out. Others would jump down from extreme heights just to regenerate back.

      The
      sight made my stomach turn.

      Are these things... unable to die...? What
      could be deserving of such punishment?!


      I looked up, the entity gone
      like a bad dream. The dark shard resonate within my very core.

      There
      was one thing I could do now, after robbing the Filter of it''s powers... Of
      course! I was the one to catalyze it!

      I kneeled down in front of my
      mom. Even though she didn''t look like her, I could tell that her soul was
      still trapped in this deformed body.

      My hand ran over her and she clung
      to it, like a cat seeking touch.

      With a snap of my finger I could end
      her suffering. But should I...? She could still experience happiness... Right?
      Maybe her state could be reverted? Maybe not all hope is lost... Hang on, just
      a little longer...'

    EidolonQuote: 'How naive of the past me to believe she could have this power
      yield to her.

      I thought to myself as I sensed another world requiring
      my attention.

      Shifting my gaze towards a planet in the far away galaxy
      revealed a rising civilization.

      Rising fast... They were bound to attract
      IT''s attention too.


      And so my journey began, drifting through space,
      admiring the view with an illusion of free will.

      Soon enough I got close
      enough to admire towering buildings and space ships setting off towards nearby
      moons.

      How troublesome.

      I spent some time watching the world
      flourish, wars be fought, countries collapsing and rebuilding. For me, it was
      but a moment. A new precious memory to hold on to.

      Nothing lasts forever
      and wars tend to drive inventions, if left unchecked they might be able to
      venture into space - given they could put their differences aside.


      With
      a sigh I descended between the skyscrapers.

      I was met with retaliation,
      of course nobody wants to die and be forgotten in the vast emptiness of space.

      Yet
      I deliver on the IT''s will, for I would be the better end for them than IT
      would be.

      And once again - another planet grew quiet.'

    EidolonQuote: 'As the world twist and turn around me. With the <i>thing</i> left
      of my mother still clutched in my arms.

      I gazed up to the cracked sky,
      the source of the disaster hang high up in the clouds.

      A black void
      with it''s shape constantly changing, like liquid in a bottle.

      Bottomless
      abyss of the cosmic entity pierced through my very being.


      The deafening
      squealing of melted humans.

      Fires broke loose, building fell and disappeared
      as if never even existing.

      I clenched my fist.

      Why didn''t I
      die, why couldn''t I meet the same fate!?

      The source of it all rested
      it''s gaze upon the only human thing on the face of now desolate planet.

      It
      must have really hated me, I thought.


      I felt myself falling. All my
      senses gone.

      A single wish sparked in my head. Why should I be the one
      to die here?

      To... die... I wanted it to die. I couldn''t die yet.

      Yet
      it wasn''t done with me... A final spit in my face.

      Deep dark shard
      crystalized in my hands, a parting gift enslaving me for eternity.'

    EidolonQuote: "I remember one planet sparking my curiosity. A blue ball with
      limited space yet cities span almost entirety of their small continents. \nNot
      advanced enough to travel space.... so why would I feel like it's time for
      them to go?\nAs I watched I began to understand. It wasn't a technological
      advancement that I've sensed. They meddle with power that did not belong to
      them and for the first time I felt... <color=red>anger</color>.\nWhy must they
      ruin the balance I'm trying my best to protect?\nPoisoning the flow of energy
      that had it's origins in me wasn't difficult at all.\nSo I observed as war
      broke out, war against something they were not ready for.\n\nI averted my gaze,
      ashamed of what I've done.\nMillenia in solitude as the harbinger of dusk.
      Have it twisted me...? Am I... Becoming like IT...?\nTo my surprise I sensed
      the planet once again.\nA small patch of land emanated burst after burst of
      energy. \nCockroaches. All of them.\n\nI descended upon it's surface wiping
      out all life but one.\nOne that refused to die.\nOne with the same look on
      it's face as the one I wore back in that day.\nFinally, I've found what I've
      been looking for this whole time."
