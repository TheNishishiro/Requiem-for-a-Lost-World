      This power coursing through my veins is exhilarating, like a never-ending rollercoaster
      ride. Got anything else up your sleeve? Bring it on, I''m ready for whatever
      comes next.



      <color=red>Don''t get too comfortable, though - this power
      doesn''t belong to you. It belongs to me.</color>

      to next? The world is mine for the taking, and I''ll stop at nothing to claim

      Am I going insane?



      <color=red>No power comes without a price, haven''t
      I warned you?</color>



      But did anyone ever listen? Didn''t even give
      me a choice to begin with! Now, I''m stuck with this curse, forced to wield
      its might.'

    EidolonQuote: 'I used to envy people from Capital, thinking their lives were
      better than mine. But after what happened, everywhere seems as bad as ever.
      Grass always seems greener on the other side, huh?



      <color=red>You
      could say that... But there''s this line those people won''t cross. I bet you
      won''t hear stories of people killing and robbing just to survive now, will
      you?</color>



      Never been there, couldn''t say. But I know one thing
      - this power has changed me forever.'
