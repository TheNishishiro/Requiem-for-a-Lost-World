      I never knew I might see one for myself! Guess a lot of weird things happen

      less surprised!

    EidolonQuote: So you have never seen anyone manipulate ice? That's interesting,
      I gained this power right after the cataclysm. I suppose everyone here has
      some "unique" abilities. Take Corina as an example, don't tell me you've seen
      someone rip appart an enemy and reassemble their organs... ugh, I never want
      to see THAT again

      Incredible! I want to explore, visit places, see things!

      ...

      No,
      I know why we came here, obviously.

      ...

      Nuh-uh, I know what''s
      on your mind, rest is important too! One time I didn''t get enough rest, you
      know, parties are still a thing and then bam! I hit my face against a brick
      wall! Wouldn''t have happened if I had enough sleep.

      Hope that''s an
      argument enough.'

      the wind, pretending to be a star. One of many on the sky, yet it could always
      be nothing more than an impostor, a pretend. It could never shine it's own
      light, nor ascend to the heavens, bound to melt away.
