      always meant for. Those old farts can clean after themselves!

      Being a royal maid has it''s benefits, sure dusting
      and sewing isn''t really fun but compared to lifes of those down under the
      castle, mine would be considered to be of a very high status... Not a peak
      human performance but I don''t need to work myself to death like they do.'

      utmost importance for every maid. \nI would and I tried but I always struggle
      to fall asleep... So I usually take a walk while everyone else is asleep, helps
      me shake away that rather irrational fear of going to sleep just to... never
      wake up again..."
