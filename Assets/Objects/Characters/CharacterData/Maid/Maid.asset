    EidolonQuote: Serving the royal family, hmpf, what a joke! I'm still young with
      great many things to achieve. Imagine thinking that they could lock me up in
      these empy hallways! Of course I would sneak out to do the great things I was
      always meant for. Those old farts can clean after themselves!

    EidolonQuote: 'Age changes your perspective of things, or so I believe, frankly,
      I wouldn''t know!

      Being a royal maid has it''s benefits, sure dusting
      and sewing isn''t really fun but compared to lifes of those down under the
      castle, mine would be considered to be of a very high status... Not a peak
      human performance but I don''t need to work myself to death like they do.'

      happened! Those old farts have it too good let me tell you that much. Can't
      wait to sneak into their shoes once they pass away one. by. one. \nI wouldn't
      make for a bad queen would I?"

    EidolonQuote: 'A new duo appeared in a castle a couple days ago with some big
      news, unfortunately all I can go off of is a gossip of other maids, how irritating!

      Regardless,
      there is something special about those two. If I were to take her place...
      Would I finally have somethin to fight for?'

    EidolonQuote: "The head maid used to say that getting a good night sleep is of
      utmost importance for every maid. \nI would and I tried but I always struggle
      to fall asleep... So I usually take a walk while everyone else is asleep, helps
      me shake away that rather irrational fear of going to sleep just to... never
      wake up again..."
