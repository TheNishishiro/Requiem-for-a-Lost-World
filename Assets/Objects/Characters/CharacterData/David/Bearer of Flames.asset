      life didn''t treat me well there either. I persevered. Bullies or gangs would
      always pick a young boy as their target, too bad for them to misjudge. '

    EidolonQuote: People say that I'm talented... Huh, way to justify your own shortcomings
      which you where too lazy to fix before getting old. I personally hate that
      term. I got into this position with my own sweat and tears, I won't let the
      so called "talent" still away my hard work.

    EidolonQuote: All the suckups aside, I do enjoy the feeling of superiority over
      others but... I think I got plenty more humble since the day I first placed
      foot into my barrack. Watching the new generation growing in strength, their
      eyes burning with passion I never had. Feels like I missed the point, maybe
      it is less about me and more about others in this whole "fighting for better
      tomorrow" thing.

    EidolonQuote: Clara has been around for the better part of my life and I would
      lie if I said I didn't crush on her ever since I was a little boy. She's probably
      the reason why I achieved all I did. She assured me many times I don't need
      to be the best, of course I get that, but how am I going to protect her if
      I'm weak.

      damage</color> and <color=green>50%</color> <color=#FFC300>damage increase</color>

      can be active at the same time.'
    EidolonQuote: "A lot has happened ever since I started working under that new
      queen. Excuse my rudness but she is rather... incapable, if I have to be honest.\nOne
      thing peaks my curiosity though. Those glass shards of hers, I've never seen
      anything like that. \nOne day it landed on my palm and I got striken with this
      sudden pain in my abdomen, sharp as getting pierced right through then the
      feeling of an overwhelming anger and regret rippled through my mind... \n\nNeedless
      to say, I stay away from them as best as I can"
