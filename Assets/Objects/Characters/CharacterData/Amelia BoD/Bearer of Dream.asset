      been clear: I can sense the emotions of those around me. It''s like an instinct,
      almost. And yet, despite being warned by Nishi that I''d get hurt because of
      my carelessness, I still push forward, driven by my desire to protect others.



      All
      I want is for everyone to be safe, to feel secure in their own lives. But at
      what cost?'

      tiny shards of glass take form, glowing softly before solidifying into tangible
      objects. It''s a beautiful process, really. As long as the wishes align, I
      can create anything.



      But the possibilities are endless, and the weight
      of responsibility is crushing me. What if someone''s wish comes true, only
      to bring about unintended consequences?'

      to ensure their safety.

      city.'

      with an unsettling feeling \u2013 something sinister lurks beneath the surface.
      I've had a dream, too, of a single black shard. It showed me... but dreams
      are nothing more than fleeting whispers in the wind.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm just
      being paranoid, but I can't shake the sense that these innocent-looking fragments
      hold secrets I'd rather not uncover."
