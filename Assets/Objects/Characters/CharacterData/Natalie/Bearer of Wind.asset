      Freedom
      into shackles.

      Love into hate.

      The blessing of freedom is nothing
      more than a mirage as the heart always bounds to something, but how does it
      feel to watch it be ripped away from you in front of your very eyes.

      With
      your act at it''s end... freedom, shall cease to exist as well'
