Ever since she was little, Chitose looked up to the knights in shining armor as they left the city to explore the unknown, deliver goods, or fight injustice. With a heart full of ambition, she embarked on a journey to fulfill her dream.

Chitose possessed a radiant spirit, always painting smiles on the faces of those around her. Whether it was fetching a missing cat, collecting groceries for an elderly lady, or caring for children in their parents' absence, she never looked down upon any task.

As she grew older, Chitose decided to apply to join the prestigious forces of the Capital. Her nimble nature allowed her to excel in every test, surpassing expectations. Eventually, her dream was partially fulfilled when she secured a position as a trainee scout. While some may have been disappointed, Chitose remained unfazed. Her parents were immensely proud, and she knew her chances for promotion still shimmered on the horizon.

Adorned in her proud red uniform, Chitose wore it with a touch of her crafty nature, subtly modifying it from time to time. Although her higher-ups didn't approve, they couldn't do much about it. After all, Chitose was just being Chitose.

After passing all of her training and exams, the moment arrived when Chitose and her fellow scouts were allowed to venture beyond the protective walls of the Capital. The vast fields and stretching forests unfolded before her, captivating her blue eyes.

"This is where my story truly begins!" she exclaimed, illuminating the atmosphere with her infectious enthusiasm.

As Chitose stepped into the unknown, she carried her dreams and aspirations, ready to face whatever challenges and adventures awaited her beyond the Capital's walls.
