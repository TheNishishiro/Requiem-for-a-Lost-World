The forest was shrouded in a dense fog, casting an eerie glow over the trees. Nishi trudged through the underbrush, his gaze fixed ahead as he guided Amelia through the thicket. She was injured, a deep gash on her leg that had yet to heal, but she pressed on regardless.

Suddenly, a voice broke the stillness of the forest.

"Hey... You there, wait a moment! Hey!" a young girl's voice called out.

Nishi's grip tightened on his sword as he turned to face the source of the voice. A young girl, about 16 years old, with short white hair and a few strands of red hair, wearing a simple red uniform commonly seen on scouts all across the Sanctuary, had emerged from the trees.

"Excuse me, are you lost? This forest can be dangerous, especially for civilians," she said, hurrying up towards the two and waving her hand.

Nishi remained cautious. "No, we're not lost. We're headed to the Capital."

"The Capital? What business do you have there?" the girl asked, a hint of curiosity in her voice.

"We have urgent matters to attend to," Nishi replied reluctantly.

"What kind of matters?" the girl pressed.

"Matters that concern the safety of Sanctuary," Nishi answered, his eyes flickering to Amelia, who looked down at her feet.

The girl noticed Amelia's bandages. "What happened to your friend?"

"She was injured in the forest," Nishi said, pausing for a moment.

"Is she okay?" the girl asked, concern etched on her face.

"She's recovering," Nishi said firmly, his protective nature over Amelia showing.

The girl looked at Amelia with interest. "Who is she?"

"Her name is Amelia. She's traveling with me," Nishi said guardedly.

"You're not from around here, are you?" the girl asked, her eyes narrowed.

"No, we're just passing through," Nishi replied coolly.

The girl, Chitose, hesitated for a moment, then offered, "Look, the forest is not safe. I can escort you to the Capital if you'd like."

Nishi considered her offer for a moment before accepting. "Very well. We accept your offer."

"Great! Let's get going then, we don't want to waste any time," Chitose said with a smile, her eyes flickering to Nishi and Amelia.

Together, the three of them set off towards the Capital, each lost in their own thoughts about what lay ahead.
