    PassiveUpgradeDescription: 
    EidolonQuote: 'In the dance of blades, where steel meets steel, patience and
      precision often prove more potent than brute force. Yet, I fear you lack both.
      Your aggression may serve you well in battle, but it is a fleeting advantage.
      True mastery lies in balance and control.



      Don''t be fooled by your
      initial victories; they will soon turn to defeats if you continue down this
      path. You would do well to learn from your mistakes and temper your passion
      with wisdom.'

    EidolonQuote: 'Do not grow accustomed to my presence. I''m merely lending a hand
      because Oana insisted upon it. Her persistence is admirable, if maddening.
      Honestly, I fail to understand her motives. Perhaps she believes you have potential,
      or perhaps she simply enjoys seeing me scowl.

      Regardless, our association
      ends when I deem it appropriate. Do not assume otherwise.



      Remember,
      my aid is conditional upon your willingness to learn and improve. Anything
      less would be an insult to my time and expertise.'

    EidolonQuote: 'You think you''re clever, don''t you? Trying to sense the secrets
      of the past through some sort of intuition. Newsflash: I have a long history,
      one that spans centuries. You already know that, don''t you? The disgusting
      thing growing inside your body might have whispered hints of it to you - Very
      well, when the time comes, I''ll cut you down myself. Don''t think for a moment
      that you can rival me.'

      per 10 levels (up to 40%)
    EidolonQuote: 'I once was a researcher, driven by curiosity and a thirst for
      knowledge. Alas, those days are behind me now. None of my discoveries or insights
      have proven useful in this new world. Better that they rot in the ashes of
      the old, alongside all else that''s been lost.



      In this era, intelligence
      is a liability, not an asset. My mind may still function, but it serves no
      purpose here. At least, not until the day we can reclaim our heritage and rebuild
      what''s been destroyed.'

      has a 60% chance to generate one stack of <color=yellow>Charge</color>. For
      every 2 stacks of <color=yellow>Charge</color> next attack will generate additional
      lightning strike '
    SkillUpgradeDescription: 'Reduce <color=#FFC300>skill cooldown</color> by <color=green>30%</color>

      Buff
      from <color=#9EFFF3>Kaminari Kiretsu</color> will always be considered to have
      at least 6 free weapon slots. '
    PassiveUpgradeDescription: 
    EidolonQuote: 'I stood witness to the downfall of civilization, watched as the
      world crumbled beneath the weight of its own hubris. I vowed then that I would
      not let such a catastrophe occur again. That is my duty as the guardian of
      this new era.



      As long as I draw breath, I will strive to protect what
      remains of humanity and prevent the repetition of past mistakes. This burden
      weighs heavily upon me, but I will carry it nonetheless.'
