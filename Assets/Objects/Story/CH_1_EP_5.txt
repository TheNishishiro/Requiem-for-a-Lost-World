Slowly, the young man's gray eyes fluttered open, and he was met with a sharp pang of pain that shot through his body. His hand instinctively went to his abdomen, where he found a wound—nothing fatal, but severe enough to make climbing back up the treacherous hole he had fallen into a nearly impossible task.

Surveying his surroundings in the pitch-black cave, he could still hear the menacing growls of the relentless monster that had pursued him. It was clear that escaping the same way he had entered was no longer an option. The only course of action left to him was to venture deeper into the cave, hoping to discover another exit as quickly as possible. The image of the young blond girl flashed before his eyes, and he whispered to himself, "I have to save her..."

Guided by the damp, unyielding walls of the cave and shrouded in complete darkness, he pressed forward, relying on touch alone. The rocky terrain beneath his hands varied, some surfaces sharp and jagged, others smoother but equally unforgiving. He had been traversing this desolate underground passage for what felt like an eternity, though only a matter of minutes had passed. The heavy, oppressive air weighed down on his battered body, making each step an arduous endeavor.

Suddenly, the sensation at his fingertips changed. No longer did he feel the jagged surface of a rock; instead, the texture felt metallic, almost artificial. The sound of his footsteps transformed as well, no longer echoing off the stone walls but resonating with a different, more manufactured tone.

"Where am I?" he wondered aloud, his voice swallowed by the oppressive silence. His exploration continued, and then, as if guided by fate, he collided with something solid and unyielding. His fingers grazed an object that, by touch alone, could only be described as a door—a door to an unknown destination hidden within the bowels of the earth.
