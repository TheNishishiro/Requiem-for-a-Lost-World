As they stepped outside, the horse stood ready, equipped with their baggage and a saddle. Elric, an almost uncle-like figure to Nishi, had helped prepare everything, knowing that Nishi had slept in. Elric was the complete opposite of Nishi's father, a kind and understanding man who taught Nishi that it was acceptable to take it easy every once in a while.

Nishi expressed his gratitude with a nod, then mounted the horse. He gestured to Amelia to sit in the cart along with their belongings. She displayed a slight pout but compiled without voicing her objections. Elric handed Nishi a sealed letter. "If you could make a small detour to deliver this for me," Elric asked. "It's for my brother, who lives in a village not far from here." Nishi agreed, considering it a good opportunity to repay Elric for all the times he had come to Nishi's aid. "I'll ensure this letter is delivered, don't worry."

Nishi waved goodbye to his parents one last time, and with a tap of his foot, he set the horse into motion, marking the beginning of their long and arduous journey. The village shrank in the distance until it was swallowed by the dense forest, and once again, it was just the two of them on the road. The memories of their first meeting and the monstrous creature that had nearly cost him his life were still fresh in Nishi's mind.
