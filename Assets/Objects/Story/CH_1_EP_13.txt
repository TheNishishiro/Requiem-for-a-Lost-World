As Nishi showed Amelia around their humble village, the girl couldn't help but feel as though it had been abandoned. The village, while not in a state of complete disrepair, appeared to be secluded and hidden away by the surrounding forest, giving it an air of solitude and calm. As they wandered through its narrow pathways and past simple wooden houses, Nishi pointed out various places and explained their functions.

Amelia tried her best to pay attention, but her thoughts kept drifting. It was as if the tranquility of the village had a hypnotic effect on her, making it difficult to concentrate on Nishi's words.

Several days passed without any major events, but the time for their journey to the Capital, the main city of the land of Sanctuary, had come. Nishi began packing essential items for their trip, and his mother, ever concerned, helped him gather what they needed.

"Make sure you come back in one piece, alright?" his mother implored with a sigh. Her worry was evident, and Nishi tried to offer reassurance, although he was never one to show much compassion. He glanced over at Amelia, who was sitting by the window, watching the villagers go about their daily activities, tending to the wood and crops, and children playing in the warm sun.

After what felt like an interminable hour, their preparations were finally complete. With food, spare clothes, self-defense tools, and the intriguing trinkets he had picked up in that dark cave, Nishi muttered to himself, "That's about it." Their departure was set for the next day.
