The gentle summer breeze returned, accompanied by the melodious chirping of the forest's wild birds. It seemed as though the wind itself was guiding them, caressing the delicate blades of grass that marked their path back to the village. The worried man's eyes darted back and forth, alternating between the narrow forest passage and the fragile girl he cradled in his arms. Her frail body shifted with each careful step he took, but the village was thankfully not far away—a half-hour or less through the dense foliage of the forest.

Amelia's eyes slowly opened once more, and she directed her gaze toward the man carrying her. Her voice, though quiet and uncertain, managed to catch his attention. "Umm... Excuse me," she began, her tone sincere and calm, "M-My name is Amelia... Thank you..."

A smile of relief and warmth illuminated the man's eyes, as if a weight had been lifted from his chest. "Nice to meet you, Amelia," he replied, introducing himself. "I'm Nishi. But please, conserve your strength for now." The girl nodded gently and closed her eyes, heeding his advice.
