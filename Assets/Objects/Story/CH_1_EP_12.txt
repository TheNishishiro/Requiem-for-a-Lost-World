Amelia's heavy eyelids gradually opened, revealing a pair of crystal-blue pupils. She felt a slight ache in her body, but it was nothing compared to the pain she had experienced before losing consciousness. As she slowly took in her surroundings, she found herself in a dimly lit room. A single window, adorned with the simplest of curtains, allowed a sliver of moonlight to filter in. The walls were made of weathered wood, with a few holes roughly patched up to keep out the cold night air. The ceiling, too, showed signs of wear and tear.

The most striking contrast in the room was the bed she lay on. Despite the shabby surroundings, it was surprisingly comfortable. Amelia couldn't help but wonder if this was the man's place, the one who had saved her in the forest. The thought brought a slight blush to her cheeks, which she quickly dismissed.

Her stomach growled loudly, reminding her of her hunger and exhaustion. On the night table beside the bed, she noticed a plate of food. It held a simple meal—a steak, mashed potatoes, and mushrooms. The dishes weren't heavily seasoned, but considering the appearance of the room, it was clear that this meal was a precious treat. Hungry and grateful, Amelia picked up her fork and began to eat.
