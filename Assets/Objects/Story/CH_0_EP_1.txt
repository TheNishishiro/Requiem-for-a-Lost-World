A gentle breeze caresses the young man's face as he finds himself seated in a dimly lit chamber, his back pressed against the chilling embrace of a metal wall. Flickering lights cast intermittent shadows, and through his weary, blurred vision, he struggles to stay conscious, his eyelids growing increasingly heavy.

A bittersweet smile graces his countenance, a poignant reminder of life's capricious nature and the tricks it plays on unsuspecting souls. "Huh..." he murmurs softly to himself, his gaze shifting to the row of blinking red lights nearby. The hurried footsteps of his companions echo down the deserted corridors, their distant echoes growing fainter with each passing second.

Despite the gravity of the situation, a bitter chuckle escapes him, the irony of meeting his end in such a forsaken place not lost on him. Only moments ago, a gaping wound had painted everything crimson, yet now, miraculously, it appears to mend itself.

Swallowing a dry lump in his throat, he clutches a piece of metal tightly in his hand, his consciousness waning against his own will. Outside, there's a commotionâ€”a cacophony of growls and frenzied scratching at the door. Dim light illuminates the object he holds, and with a heavy sigh, he closes his eyes, raising his trembling hand.
