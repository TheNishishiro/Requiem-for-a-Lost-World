An eerie stillness descended upon the once-peaceful forest, shrouding it in an unsettling darkness as if a switch had been flipped. The young man's instincts kicked in, and he swiftly reached for his bow, fingers deftly finding their familiar places. His thoughts raced, and a question emerged in his mind: "A bear?"

But a nagging doubt tugged at him, a suspicion that perhaps this disturbance was of a different, more ominous nature. "Might be something bigger..." he mused. For a fleeting moment, he contemplated retreating, stepping away from whatever unseen force had disrupted the forest's calm. Yet, it was the eerie silence that now enveloped the woods that truly unnerved him. Why hadn't the birds taken flight at the approach of a bear? Many perplexing thoughts raced through his mind as he tried to make sense of his increasingly dire situation.

The sound of rustling leaves and the unsettling thumping of something large drew nearer, steadily advancing in his direction. He shook his head to clear his thoughts, knocking an arrow and taking cover behind a sturdy tree. He knew these woods like the back of his hand; their denizens, though wild and unpredictable, were seldom excessively dangerous. So why did a sense of imminent peril grip him so tightly? His grip on the bow grew vice-like, his fingers leaving an impression on the well-worn wood.

The cacophony of rustling leaves and the cracking of trees, falling or being pushed down with terrifying force, reached a crescendo. A dense bush only a few meters away shook violently, as if it were convulsing with fear, and then disgorged an unexpected sight: a young girl with luminous, sun-kissed blond hair, her form bathed in the golden light of summer. The young man's eyes widened in astonishment at her sudden appearance, but his shock was short-lived.

Above the girl, a much larger and malevolent presence loomed, casting a shadow over her with malicious intent.
