Nishi left the bedroom, gently closing the door behind him, leaving the scent of freshly prepared food to linger in the closed room where Amelia rested. He sighed as he made his way to the opposite side of the house, where his father sat at a wooden table, quietly sipping on a cup of water. He waited for his father to speak, knowing that their conversation held a weighty topic.

The old man glanced up and chuckled weakly, attempting a poor joke. "Oh, it's you. I never thought I'd see the day you'd bring a girl into this household."

Nishi's response was calm but firm. "Now is not the time." He placed the blade on the table, its faint moonlight-like glow still emanating. "Do you have any idea what this might be?"

His father examined the sword carefully before shaking his head. "I've never seen a material like this before. You say you found it underground?"

Nishi nodded and proceeded to describe the events that had transpired in the forest. After listening intently, the old man looked down at the floor, his mind processing the new information. He muttered to himself, "It might be worth relaying that story to the Capital..."
