The village they had arrived in seemed to be in a similar state of disrepair as Nishi's own. Small, remote villages struggled to secure the funds for any significant improvements, and their primary focus was merely on day-to-day survival. Nishi helped Amelia off the horse and tied it to a wooden post near a tree. Then, he extended his hand to her, offering guidance.

"You won't get lost this way," he said with a kind smile. Her face flushed with embarrassment, but she accepted his hand and held onto it. They looked around the quiet village, where mostly elderly residents were engaged in their daily routines or sat on benches observing newcomers with a mix of curiosity and suspicion. Houses varied, some with names on them and others unmarked, making it challenging to find Will, the intended recipient of the letter.

Amelia decided to approach a friendly-looking grandma and inquired, "Excuse me, do you know where Will lives?" The elderly woman kindly pointed towards a house located further away. She returned to Nishi's side with a proud expression.

Nishi and Amelia walked over to the indicated house and knocked on the door. After a moment, an elderly man opened the door, looking surprised by their presence.

"Hello, my name is Nishi. I have a letter from Elric to deliver. Mr. Will, I presume?" Nishi asked.

The old man recognized Nishi and said, "Ah, it's you! Yes, come on in... I will prepare something to drink."

Nishi declined the offer, saying, "No need, we are only passing by. Please don't bother yourself."

"I insist! Come on, don't keep me waiting. Get inside."

Nishi exchanged a look with Amelia and agreed to enter the old man's house, which appeared as weathered on the inside as it did from the outside. Once in the house, Nishi took a seat at a table, the sturdiest piece of furniture in the place, and Amelia snuggled up beside him.

The old man returned shortly after with three mugs of tea, placing them on the table with shaky hands. He asked about Elric's well-being and mentioned that he thought Elric had forgotten about him.

"No, he's quite fine," Nishi replied. "He made a name for himself in Adaka."

"Is that so?" the old man responded with a chuckle. "You should tell him to visit personally next time."

Nishi attempted to explain that they had important matters to attend to when their conversation was abruptly cut short by explosions and screams coming from outside. Nishi grabbed Amelia's hand and rushed outside, only to witness the once peaceful village engulfed in flames.

The same yet different creatures, which defied the laws of reality, had appeared suddenly. Some of these beings were tall, others shorter, with features ranging from black tentacles to wing-like structures. All were armed with sharp teeth and claws.

The horrifying scene unfolded before their eyes. Amelia's helplessly asked questions earlier from the old villagers had now turned into terrifying screams. Will was still inside his house, and Nishi could see him just making his way outside when a creature landed on the rooftop. The creature crashed the entire structure to the ground and fixed its menacing, glowing red gaze on the young pair.

Nishi pushed Amelia behind one of the houses, desperate to keep her safe. He yelled at her, "Quickly run to the horse and get as far away as you can, NOW!" Her eyes filled with tears as she hesitated for a moment, her hand reaching toward him but retracting. With a final look of hope, she ran toward the tree where the horse was tied, praying that the horse remained unharmed, and that she could escape the attention of these nightmarish creatures.
