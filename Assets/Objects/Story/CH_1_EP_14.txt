The morning sun cast a gentle glow in the bedroom, a soft reminder that a new day had begun. Nishi, still on the bed, rubbed his eyes, unsure if he was any more prepared for the upcoming journey than he was a few days ago. He had never been to the Capital or its vicinity, and the peaceful past days made him question whether the trip was necessary. However, he pushed these thoughts aside.

His eyes drifted to Amelia, who lay beside him. Initially, he had reservations about sharing his bed, but with no other suitable place to sleep, he decided it was the most practical solution. To his surprise, he found her presence comforting.

Nudging her shoulder gently, he woke her up. Amelia's eyes slowly opened, squinting as they adjusted to the morning light. "Wake up, we have a long road ahead of us," Nishi said. She yawned and nodded sleepily before sitting up, still in a state of disarray. Nishi chuckled, then got up himself, indicating that it was time to depart.
