The journey continued, and Nishi looked at the letter addressed to Will. He had only vague memories of the man, but he knew it had been years since he last saw him, making it unlikely that he would recognize Will's face now.

Behind him, Amelia held on tightly as she sat behind Nishi on the horse. She had refused to ride in the cart, insisting on sitting on the horse behind him.

"Hey, Nishi, sorry for the trouble," she mumbled, as if blaming herself for the current situation.

Nishi turned his head slightly to glance at her. "What do you mean?"

"You wouldn't have to go through all of this if you never had to rescue me..."

Nishi shook his head and responded, "Don't be silly. Besides, that monster could have attacked the village. It's better that we stopped it there. Meeting you probably saved my parents and all the villagers."

"You think so?" she asked, her voice hesitant.

"Mhm, don't worry about anything. Besides, I might use a change of environment," Nishi said with a chuckle, trying to lighten the mood. It seemed to work, as Amelia visibly relaxed again, though she remained focused on staying atop the moving horse.

Once more, silence settled between them, and it felt natural. There was no need to fill the quiet with words when none were necessary. Signs of civilization began to appear, indicating that their next destination, the village of Kiku, was just ahead.
