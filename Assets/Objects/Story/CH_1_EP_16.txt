As they traveled through the quiet forest, the sounds of their cart creaking and the horse's footsteps provided the background noise. Nishi hoped for a bit of solitude, but his last journey outside the village to visit Elric's brother was when he was still a child, able to entertain himself with almost anything. He turned his gaze towards Amelia, who appeared equally bored, sitting in the cart and occasionally gazing at the clouds, which were sometimes hidden by the thick foliage of the trees.

Nishi attempted to start a conversation, asking if she needed a break. Her reply was a simple, "No, I'm fine."

"We have a long road ahead of us," he continued. "Would you mind telling me something about yourself?" He was curious, as they hadn't really discussed their pasts or where she was from. Her deep blue eyes blinked a few times as she looked at him, seemingly surprised by the question. "I don't remember much... I might have gotten hit too hard there," she began. "All I remember is that I had to cross a really big body of water on some makeshift boat, and then I ran until I couldn't anymore... The next thing I remember is waking up at your place." She appeared visibly confused, struggling to recall the order of events or any significant details. "It's alright," Nishi reassured her. "Maybe you came from the North? I heard it's separated by a sea... if I'm not mistaken." He paused, considering, and added, "But crossing it without a proper boat would be insane." She shook her head, expressing another gap in her memory. "That's what I remember. I'm sure it will come back to me sooner or later," she said with a warm smile, which seemed to better suit her overall demeanor.

"You know what? Maybe I'd like a break," she said after a brief moment of silence, interrupted only by the rumbling of her stomach. "We haven't had time to eat breakfast yet..."
